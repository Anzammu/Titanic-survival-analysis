# 🛳️ Titanic Survival Analysis – EDA with ydata-profiling

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the famous **Titanic dataset**, using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and **ydata-profiling** to automatically generate a profiling report.  

The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, clean the data, and engineer new features that can later be used in predictive Machine Learning models.

## 📊 Project Content
- **Data Cleaning**: handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent entries.  
- **Univariate Analysis**: distribution of categorical and numerical features (e.g., Sex, Age, Fare).  
- **Bivariate Analysis**: relationships between features (e.g., Sex vs. Survival, Pclass vs. Survival).  
- **Feature Engineering**: creation of new useful features such as:
  - `FamilySize = SibSp + Parch`
  - Titles extracted from the `Name` column
  - Age grouped into categories (Child, Adult, Senior)  
- **Automatic Profiling Report**: generated with `ydata-profiling` for a full dataset overview.
